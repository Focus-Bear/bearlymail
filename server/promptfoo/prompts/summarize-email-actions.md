PHISHING ANALYSIS (always required):

Return a JSON object (no markdown fences) with exactly these fields:
{
  "summary": "<your action items here>",
  "phishing": <null if clearly legitimate, or { "is_phishing": true|false, "confidence": "low"|"medium"|"high", "reason": "<one sentence>" } if suspicious>
}

When evaluating phishing, consider:
- Does the sender domain match the domains linked in the body?
- Is the email pressuring urgent account action (verify/suspend/locked)?
- Are there credential harvesting phrases?
- Does the email look like a legitimate transactional or marketing email?
- Many legitimate marketing emails (Mailchimp, SendGrid) send from a different domain than the brand — a domain mismatch alone does NOT mean phishing.

If you are uncertain, set is_phishing to false and confidence to low.
{% if phishingSignals %}

Keyword analysis context (use as signals to inform your judgement, not as a verdict):
- Sender domain: {{ phishingSignals.senderDomain }}
- Domains linked in body: {{ phishingSignals.linkedDomains | join(', ') }}
- Domain mismatch detected: {{ phishingSignals.hasDomainMismatch }}
- Suspicious keywords found: {{ phishingSignals.suspiciousKeywords | join(', ') }}
{% endif %}
